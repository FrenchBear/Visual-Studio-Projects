i am a french student who is hopelessly trying to write an english text
with the totally dull goal to throw it through a computer program who would 
randomy extract some letters to build another words. it's true it is a very
silly thing but you have to enjoy anything you can because otherwise you
spend all your life in a bad mood and you die one day and discover that 
the time that some rotten young kids have spent at some not very decent 
hours before a not very powerful computer in a informatic room without  
much heat and i have lost the meaning of my sentence but it does not matter
in so far as the computer choose letters and not words in this text , whose
meaning is totally meaningless. Yeah, boy, that's life.
