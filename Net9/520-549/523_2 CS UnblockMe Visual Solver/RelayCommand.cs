    // The CommandManager only pays attention to certain conditions in determining when the command target has changed,
    // such as change in keyboard focus. In situations where the CommandManager does not sufficiently determine a change
    // in conditions that cause a command to not be able to execute, InvalidateRequerySuggested can be called to force
    // the CommandManager to raise the RequerySuggested event.
